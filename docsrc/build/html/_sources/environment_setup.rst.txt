**DELETE_LOCAL_FILES**: Keep downloaded files on the local machine or not. 
This setting doesn't matter when using Docker. Suggested: True.

**DB_SERVER, DB, DB_USER, DB_PWD, DB_SCHEMA**: Variables used by 
`sqlsorcery <https://sqlsorcery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/environment.html>`_.

**DB_RAW_TABLE**: Name of the database table that the Application Data 
file data goes into.

**SPROC_RAW_PREP**: Name of the pre-processing sproc that backs up and 
truncates the Application Data table.

**SPROC_RAW_POST**: Name of the post-processing sproc that sets the 
SchoolYear4Digit column and restores from backup if the Application Data table is empty.

**SPROC_CHANGE_TRACK**: Name of the sproc that generates the Change History 
records.

**SPROC_FACT_DAILY**: Name of the sproc that generates the Fact Daily Status 
records.

**FTP_HOSTNAME, FTP_USERNAME, FTP_PWD**: FTP server connection variables.

**ARCHIVE_MAX_DAYS**: Files older than this number of days will be deleted from the FTP.

**API_DOMAIN, API_ACCOUNT_EMAIL**: SchoolMint API connection credentials. _REGIONAL and _ENROLLOAK are for the two separate reports.

**API_TOKEN**: API Token for the Application Data report. Provided by SchoolMint. 
This token must be updated from year to year because each enrollment period has a unique report.

**CURRENT_SCHOOL_YEAR**: 4 digit enrollment school year (eg. 2021 during the 19-20 SY). 
This populates the SchoolYear4Digit column in the raw data tables. 
This must be updated when new reports are acquired for the next school year.

**GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_PWD, TO_NAME, TO_ADDRESS, BCC_ADDRESS**: 
Email credentials and addresses that job status notification emails will be sent to. 
BCC_ADDRESS is optional.
